# Exploring Characterization and Scheduling of Application Phases for Energy-Efficiency using Machine Learning
An adaptive runtime mechanism that observes the behavior of tasks (through PMCs) and dynamically characterizes the application phase and allocates it to the appropriate core.

## Development

Run the Jupyter Notebook using the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
